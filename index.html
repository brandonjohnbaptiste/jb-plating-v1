                <p>Do you remove monograms?</p>
            </summary>
            <p>
               Monograms on silver are part of the object's history and should not be removed for this reason. Museums use monograms to help trace an object's provenance. Beautiful engraving is a work of artâ€”an art form quickly disappearing. Sadly, most antique dealers indiscriminately remove monograms to make the object more saleable.
            </p>
            <p>
               Having said this, if you insist on having the engraving removed, I will agree to eradicate it. I would rather remove the monogram than have the object brought to someone less skilled. I have no reservations in removing machine engraving from mass-produced flatware. Keep in mind that if a monogram is deeply engraved on the bottom of a thin tray, for example, the results may not be desirable, for any weight placed on that area could possibly produce a dent. You will be consulted before I remove engraving from any object in question.

                <p>Can you give me a price on a repair?</p>
            </summary>
            <p>
                If you can e-mail me images of the pieces, along with the makers marks (usually illustrated on the bottoms of the objects), I will be able to give you ballpark pricing.
                Thickness of the silver plating, so only a quick polishing with a very fine polishing compound is possible which will brighten the object. Attempting to remove scratches will only cut through the plate and expose the base metal.
